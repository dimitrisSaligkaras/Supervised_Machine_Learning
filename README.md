# Supervised_Machine_Learning
 A Robust Supervised Machine Learning Technique (Naive Bayes Classifiers) used to classify Covid 19 patients in need of care at the intense unit or not. The dataset is provided by the Mexican Medical System.  The project was made, among others, during my internship at the Hellenic Statistical Authority. The data came from the Mexican Medical Îœinistry. 18.000 patients with symptoms of Covid 19 went for help to local hospitals. For every person the medical staff recorded the existence of 13 characteristics such as the age and 11  diseases like diabetes, cardiovascular problems, hypertension etc. After that , for every person was recorded the insertion at the intense care unit (icu) or not. Using the Supervised Machine Learning technique of the Naive Bayes Classifiers with some extra tools I was able to achieve a probability of 2/3 for the right guess for a patient. This is extremely significant as only with the recording of the existence of some diseases ,that had already been known by the individual himself ,  we were able to decide ,at a 2/3 probability of right guess, if a person should be inserted to the intense care unit or not.  Something like that in cases like the India where doctors do not even have the time for further examinations , might have been helpful for the decisions taken.
